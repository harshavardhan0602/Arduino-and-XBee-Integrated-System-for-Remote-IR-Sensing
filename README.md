# Arduino-and-XBee-Integrated-System-for-Remote-IR-Sensing
This project aims to develop a wireless remote sensing system utilizing Arduino microcontrollers and XBee modules. The system is designed to monitor infrared (IR) sensor data and transmit it wirelessly using ZigBee-based XBee radios, creating an efficient and scalable mesh network for remote sensing applications.
